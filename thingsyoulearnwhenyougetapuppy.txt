You can't leave anything on ANYTHING.
Things will turn up missing at any point in time.
You will have to replace important things... like your cell phone.
You may have an ulcer if he gets through the fenced in area.
You become an expert at washing poop off your foot/shoe.
The highlight of your day is when he sits when you say sit. 
You realize his cuteness will let him have his way most of the time.
You feel completely accomplished when he actually poops outside. 
He's the only living thing in your life that will never hold a grudge.
You realize the small cuddling being next to you makes all of his naughtiness go away.
